Today I stand with workers across the country who are participating in the #StrikeForBlackLives. Our job as a nation: eradicate all forms of racial injustice in every part of our society so that Black Americans can finally live in security and dignity.
==========
We have got to transform our priorities. We should not pass a $740 billion defense budget at a time when so many are struggling.
==========
Tens of millions of Americans have filed for unemployment and this is what the Republicans are offering? Instead, we should extend unemployment benefits, provide $2,000 a month to every American, and expand Medicare to all.
==========
In recent months 30 million workers have lost their jobs and their income. Many struggle to put food on the table. This week the Senate must pass a bill to fully extend unemployment benefits, provide a $2,000 monthly stipend and guarantee health care for the length of the crisis.
==========
In the richest nation in the world, people are forced to risk their lives for starvation wages. That is a moral outrage. Every worker deserves a living wage and a safe workplace, especially in the middle of a deadly pandemic.
==========
The U.S.A. is the only major country not to guarantee health care to all. If you're wealthy you can buy excellent care. If you're poor or working class, tough luck. You die younger and experience more illness and pain. Health care is a human right. We need Medicare for All.
==========
Amidst the many crises we face, we cannot ignore that the climate crisis is getting worse. Now is the time to end our dependence on fossil fuels and move to renewable energy. Now is the time for a Green New Deal.
==========
Against the wishes of state and local officials, unmarked federal agents in combat gear have invaded parts of Portland, Oregon. This is what a police state looks like.  These troops must be withdrawn immediately. We must defend the Constitution. We must defeat Trump.
==========
We must reduce the military budget by 10% and use that $74 billion in savings to invest in communities ravaged by extreme poverty, mass incarceration, decades of neglect and the COVID-19 pandemic.
==========
In 2018, Floridians overwhelmingly voted to re-enfranchise felons. The outrageous poll tax passed in response to that referendum is racist voter suppression at its worst. Voting is a right, not a privilege. These attacks on Americans’ constitutional rights have got to end.
==========
It's time to rethink what we value as a society and to fundamentally transform our national priorities. Cutting the military budget by 10% and investing that money in human needs is a modest way to begin that process. Let's get it done.
==========
I stand with the workers and immigrants in New York fighting for a just coronavirus relief package and to #FundExcludedWorkers. We cannot get through this pandemic without protecting the most vulnerable among us.
==========
Because of Trump's ineptitude the pandemic is getting worse. He must be defeated.

==========
During the pandemic, while a record-breaking 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance, UnitedHealth—one of the largest health insurance companies in America—made a record-breaking quarterly profit of $6.6 billion.
==========
While 28 million Americans are in danger of being evicted from their homes and thrown out on the street, JP Morgan Chase posted a record-breaking $33.8 billion in quarterly revenue.
==========
While one out of five Americans cannot afford the medicine prescribed by their doctors, the CEO of Moderna became a billionaire overnight after his company received $483 million from the Trump administration to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine.==========
==========
While American households have lost $6.5 trillion in wealth and 50 million Americans have filed for unemployment, the wealth of 600 billionaires in America has gone up by $584 billion.
==========
While Amazon refuses to provide paid sick leave to its workers and recently eliminated hazard pay for essential workers, the owner of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, has seen his wealth go up by $74 billion making him the wealthiest person in America with a net worth of $179 billion.==========
==========
While Americans pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs, Gilead is charging more than $3,000 for a COVID-19 drug that costs $10 to manufacture and was developed after receiving a $70 million grant from the federal government.
==========
While 29 new people in America became billionaires, 119 million Americans have seen their income go down.
==========
Pharmaceutical companies have been given $6 billion in taxpayer dollars, and more to come, to develop a coronavirus vaccine. Once a safe and effective vaccine is approved by the FDA it must be made available to all for free. This is no time for profiteering.
==========
Here's the state of our economy.

Over the last 30 years, the top 1% has seen an increase in  wealth of $22 trillion, while the bottom 50% has actually seen a decline in wealth.

We must fight for an economy that works for all, not just the few.
==========
We must change our priorities and invest in the needs of working Americans, not spend billions on our bloated defense budget.
==========
As the pandemic surges, Trump is more clueless, isolated and unhinged than ever. He is undermining Dr. Fauci, and believes that "everyone is lying" about COVID-19, including the CDC. For the sake of science and the health of our nation, Trump must be defeated.
==========
Trump is finally wearing a mask. Too little too late.

His refusal to develop national pandemic policy based on science has led to widespread confusion and cost us many thousands of lives.

Trump has rejected science. In November, we must come together and reject Trump.
==========
Trump commutes Roger Stone's sentence, while Black and Brown kids sit in jail. This is why we need major reform of a broken and racist criminal justice system. No more two-tier justice. Rich or poor, Black, white or Latino — we need "equal justice under law."
==========
Mitt Romney and I hold different opinions on virtually everything. But I agree with him strongly that Trump's commutation of Roger Stone's sentence is "unprecedented, historic corruption." The key political question of our time is: Where are all the other Republicans?
==========
It's summer. It's hot. It's vacation time. Sadly, the U.S. is the only major country not to guarantee any paid vacation or holidays. The result: 1 in 4 workers get no paid vacation time or holidays. This is outrageous. We need an economy that works for workers, not just owners.
