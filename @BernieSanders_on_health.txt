Trump's rally in Tulsa is indoors, with no social distancing and no mask requirements—all in violation of CDC guidelines. Trump is willing to spread the COVID-19 virus in order to hear some cheers. He is a direct threat to the health of the American people. He must be defeated.

This is what narcissism is about. Trump, in order to hear cheers from an adoring crowd, will defy science and sacrifice lives—not just those who go to his rally but those they come in contact with. For the health of the American people he must be defeated.

Trump's not only a terrible president, he is a threat to the health of the country. He's rejected science, downplayed the danger of the virus and promoted quack remedies.

Here is one more reason why we need to end mass incarceration. In American jails and prisons at least 64,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 and 589 inmates and workers have died. Today we're looking at an unprecedented level of capital punishment.https://t.co/0MisplGpyL

It is outrageous that Trump, in the middle of a pandemic, is working to prevent LGBTQ+ Americans from getting health care they need. Discrimination of any kind has no place in our society. We must defeat Trump, guarantee health care as a right and protect all LGBTQ+ Americans. https://t.co/aNhYc2R4M5

Trump wants 15,000 delegates cheering him at his GOP convention in Florida. No social distancing. His rejection of medical advice endangers not only those there but those they come in contact with. Trump's a threat to the health and well-being of the country. He must be defeated.

Trump and too many Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to approve a defense budget increasing military spending to $740 billion a year. Wrong! We should cut military spending and invest in jobs, education, housing and health care. I will introduce legislation to do that.

We have a system today where, while millions lose their jobs, struggle to put food on the table, and cannot afford an education or health care, billionaires have gotten $565 billion richer during a pandemic. That is a system we cannot accept.

Racial injustice goes far beyond police brutality. Black families have 1/10th the wealth of white families, over half of Black workers earn less than $15/hour, and Black families are much less likely to have decent health insurance. The fight for justice continues on all fronts.

100,000 are dead from coronavirus, 40 million apply for unemployment benefits, 20% of children are hungry, millions face eviction and lack health care. Meanwhile, Trump and Republican leadership don't see the "urgency" for new legislation to protect the working class. Outrageous!

Let's hope that, after clinical trials, this vaccine proves effective. If so, the government must negotiate a fair price with the company, and then distribute the vaccine free to all Americans.

Before this crisis, half of our people lived paycheck to paycheck.

Tens of millions had no health insurance.

Some 40 million people lived in poverty. 500,000 slept on the streets.

We cannot just go "back to normal."

We must go forward and build an economy that works for all.

It is catastrophic that tens of millions of Americans are losing their health insurance—on top of the millions already uninsured. 

Medicare must be empowered to cover all health care expenses during this crisis. 

We can not abandon the American people.

Instead of subsidizing COBRA — which would be a massive giveaway to the health insurance industry — Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the health care bills of the uninsured and under-insured until this crisis is over.

We cannot continue to tie health insurance coverage to your employment. Medicare for All now. https://t.co/s35AWagXGS

In April, 26.4 percent of workers lost their jobs or had their hours reduced.

What must be in the next relief bill:

➡️Guarantee workers continue to receive their paychecks
➡️Universal health coverage
➡️$2,000 monthly payments for all
➡️Fund and protect the United States Postal Service
➡️Ensure relief is accessible to immigrants and the undocumented

Tens of millions of people are not only losing their jobs.

They are losing their health insurance. 

We cannot continue to tie your ability to get health care to your employment. 

Medicare for All is a moral imperative.

This is the richest country on Earth. 

We can get through this crisis. 

But it is imperative that right now we protect workers and ensure they continue to have both income and health care.

Nancy Pelosi is right. We must include the Paycheck Security Act in the next emergency legislation. The best way to protect our economy is to guarantee that, in the midst of this terrible crisis, workers continue receiving their paychecks and health care.
https://t.co/MLTobZCb2K

You need health care whether you’re working or not, whether you have a good- or bad-paying job, whether you’re old or a kid.

Health care must be a human right. 

If we don’t learn that lesson right now, we will never learn that lesson.

71% of jobless Americans did not receive unemployment benefits in March. That is shameful.

Congress has got to guarantee paychecks, health care and $2,000 a month to every American until this crisis ends. The American people cannot afford to wait.
https://t.co/gGslWJTBNa

Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties health care to jobs? Or do we need a simple, comprehensive and cost-effective system that understands that health care is a human right for all of our people?

We must use this time to reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future. 

Let us, finally, guarantee health care to all our people as a human right.
https://t.co/PLz41C9hsU

I am disgusted that health insurance companies want to profit off the pandemic. Spending hundreds of billions on COBRA is a giveaway to health insurance CEOs and leaves millions uninsured.

In the last six weeks 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

It is simply irresponsible and dangerous to the public to allow millions of people in this country to go without health coverage as a pandemic rips through our communities. 

During the pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket health costs for all Americans.

Average cost of coronavirus treatment for patients in intensive care: over $30,000

Percentage of Americans who wouldn't go to the doctor for coronavirus symptoms due to the cost: 14%

We need to guarantee health care as a human right now more than ever. https://t.co/L5BA5kaXpS

As tens of millions of Americans are losing their jobs and incomes as a result of the pandemic, many of them are also losing their health insurance.

We need Medicare for All.

In truth, we don’t have a health care “system.” We have a byzantine network of medical institutions dominated by the profit-making interests of insurance and drug companies.

Instead of bailing out the health care insurance industry during this crisis, Medicare should be required to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and underinsured. That's what I'm fighting for. No one should be denied care because of the cost.

We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.

We must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All.

Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers.

The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.
 
That means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.
 
Under Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job.

While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick.

We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy.

Americans deserve better than a health care system where  people are terrified and need treatment, but are afraid to go to the doctor or emergency room because they cannot afford the bill. They deserve Medicare for All.

We must construct emergency shelters and utilize vacant lodging to provide survivors of domestic violence the shelter, the health care and the nutrition they need, and to connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. https://t.co/DER7G1VvzB

We must move forward on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package.

This bill must protect workers, not hand out more corporate welfare. 

It must provide a full paycheck for laid off workers for the duration of the crisis, and guarantee health care for all.

Our health care system should be about protecting lives, not making huge profits for corporations.

We are facing estimates of over 100,000 coronavirus deaths. It is outrageous that a Philadelphia real estate investor who closed a hospital is now trying to gouge the city to re-open it. @HelenGymPHL is right: the city should reopen Hahnemann hospital immediately. https://t.co/V08gYcxxfq

There is something very, very wrong when we spend twice as much per capita on health care as other major countries, yet tens of millions are uninsured and we have worse health outcomes.

The profit-driven health care system has got to change.

We need Medicare for All.

Our dysfunctional health care system must be replaced by a Medicare for All, single-payer system, which not only guarantees health care for everyone as a right, but has a strong public health component which prepares our country for health care crises like the coronavirus.

Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace. https://t.co/sZrb6FcUPz

Not surprisingly, the Republican plan for the coronavirus pandemic is totally inadequate. 

It benefits the rich and large corporations, creates desperation for poor and working families and goes nowhere near far enough to address the health and economic crises we're facing.

Uninsured Americans not only have to worry about getting sick from the coronavirus.

They have to worry about whether getting health care would bankrupt them.

During an international crisis or not, health care must always be a right.

Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people.

We are the richest country in the history of the world. Every worker deserves a living wage, paid leave, health care, and a union—at all times, not just during a national crisis.

Our current health care system does not have the doctors and nurses we currently need. During this crisis, we need to mobilize medical residents, retired medical professionals, and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis.

We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get health care they need regardless of their income. In this crisis we must empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency.

I proudly stood with @PennaNurses and @District1199C to fight the closure of Hahnemann. We must re-open such hospitals and fund the creation of new facilities to address this pandemic. I hope that other cities and states will follow Philadelphia's lead. https://t.co/jhnJO8nH0m

Thank you @JamesThompsonKS for speaking out and sharing your story. We're going to take on the health insurance greed that is stopping too many Americans from getting the necessary care they need. https://t.co/uSMVXAV5rP

The insurance industry lies that Medicare for All will mean "long wait times."

Read these replies.

There is an endless wait in America happening now—for those waiting to be able to afford care they need.

Medicare for All means no more putting off care due to cost. https://t.co/OyfhL8E65S

What the establishment used to say about our ideas:

Raising the minimum wage to a living wage—too radical.
Guaranteeing health care to all—too radical.
Aggressively combating climate change—too radical.
Not having a super PAC—too radical.

We must set a national goal of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. by the year 2025 so that HIV is no longer a public health threat to any community in the U.S. and that people with HIV are able to live long, healthy lives. https://t.co/mk37Xoo5Ql

I reject the idea that we can afford to pay for endless wars in the Middle East but not health care for all of our children.

This is what happened when people in the U.K. were asked how much health care costs in the U.S.

Remember that our outrageous for-profit system is not the norm in other countries.

We can and we must do better.

We need Medicare for All now.

Well, I don't think any American should go bankrupt or die because they can't afford the health care they need. #DemDebate

Here are the questions we should be asking about Medicare for All:

➡️Why should pharma companies be able to charge whatever they want?
➡️How much money do insurance companies spend to buy politicians? https://t.co/WDJIYfCMhM

Amazon made $11,200,000,000 in profits last year.

It is simply not true that we cannot afford to invest in housing or health care or education.

Dental care is a human right.
Mental health care is a human right.
Reproductive health care is a human right.

That is why they’re covered under Medicare for All.

We're told we can't afford to invest in the housing, health care and education our people need.

Meanwhile, giant corporations are paying ZERO in federal income taxes.

When we stand up to the corporate elite, we can make real change for our country. https://t.co/Qj5QqBNX4e
