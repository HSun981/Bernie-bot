Trump's rally in Tulsa is indoors, with no social distancing and no mask requirements—all in violation of CDC guidelines. Trump is willing to spread the COVID-19 virus in order to hear some cheers. He is a direct threat to the health of the American people. He must be defeated.

This is what narcissism is about. Trump, in order to hear cheers from an adoring crowd, will defy science and sacrifice lives—not just those who go to his rally but those they come in contact with. For the health of the American people he must be defeated.

Trump's not only a terrible president, he is a threat to the health of the country. He's rejected science, downplayed the danger of the virus and promoted quack remedies.

Here is one more reason why we need to end mass incarceration. In American jails and prisons at least 64,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 and 589 inmates and workers have died. Today we're looking at an unprecedented level of capital punishment.https://t.co/0MisplGpyL

It is outrageous that Trump, in the middle of a pandemic, is working to prevent LGBTQ+ Americans from getting health care they need. Discrimination of any kind has no place in our society. We must defeat Trump, guarantee health care as a right and protect all LGBTQ+ Americans. https://t.co/aNhYc2R4M5

Trump wants 15,000 delegates cheering him at his GOP convention in Florida. No social distancing. His rejection of medical advice endangers not only those there but those they come in contact with. Trump's a threat to the health and well-being of the country. He must be defeated.

Trump and too many Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to approve a defense budget increasing military spending to $740 billion a year. Wrong! We should cut military spending and invest in jobs, education, housing and health care. I will introduce legislation to do that.

We have a system today where, while millions lose their jobs, struggle to put food on the table, and cannot afford an education or health care, billionaires have gotten $565 billion richer during a pandemic. That is a system we cannot accept.

Racial injustice goes far beyond police brutality. Black families have 1/10th the wealth of white families, over half of Black workers earn less than $15/hour, and Black families are much less likely to have decent health insurance. The fight for justice continues on all fronts.

100,000 are dead from coronavirus, 40 million apply for unemployment benefits, 20% of children are hungry, millions face eviction and lack health care. Meanwhile, Trump and Republican leadership don't see the "urgency" for new legislation to protect the working class. Outrageous!

Let's hope that, after clinical trials, this vaccine proves effective. If so, the government must negotiate a fair price with the company, and then distribute the vaccine free to all Americans.

Before this crisis, half of our people lived paycheck to paycheck.

Tens of millions had no health insurance.

Some 40 million people lived in poverty. 500,000 slept on the streets.

We cannot just go "back to normal."

We must go forward and build an economy that works for all.

It is catastrophic that tens of millions of Americans are losing their health insurance—on top of the millions already uninsured. 

Medicare must be empowered to cover all health care expenses during this crisis. 

We can not abandon the American people.

Instead of subsidizing COBRA — which would be a massive giveaway to the health insurance industry — Medicare must be empowered to pay all of the health care bills of the uninsured and under-insured until this crisis is over.

We cannot continue to tie health insurance coverage to your employment. Medicare for All now. https://t.co/s35AWagXGS

In April, 26.4 percent of workers lost their jobs or had their hours reduced.

What must be in the next relief bill:

➡️Guarantee workers continue to receive their paychecks
➡️Universal health coverage
➡️$2,000 monthly payments for all
➡️Fund and protect the United States Postal Service
➡️Ensure relief is accessible to immigrants and the undocumented

Tens of millions of people are not only losing their jobs.

They are losing their health insurance. 

We cannot continue to tie your ability to get health care to your employment. 

Medicare for All is a moral imperative.

This is the richest country on Earth. 

We can get through this crisis. 

But it is imperative that right now we protect workers and ensure they continue to have both income and health care.

Nancy Pelosi is right. We must include the Paycheck Security Act in the next emergency legislation. The best way to protect our economy is to guarantee that, in the midst of this terrible crisis, workers continue receiving their paychecks and health care.
https://t.co/MLTobZCb2K

You need health care whether you’re working or not, whether you have a good- or bad-paying job, whether you’re old or a kid.

Health care must be a human right. 

If we don’t learn that lesson right now, we will never learn that lesson.

71% of jobless Americans did not receive unemployment benefits in March. That is shameful.

Congress has got to guarantee paychecks, health care and $2,000 a month to every American until this crisis ends. The American people cannot afford to wait.
https://t.co/gGslWJTBNa

Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties health care to jobs? Or do we need a simple, comprehensive and cost-effective system that understands that health care is a human right for all of our people?

We must use this time to reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future. 

Let us, finally, guarantee health care to all our people as a human right.
https://t.co/PLz41C9hsU

I am disgusted that health insurance companies want to profit off the pandemic. Spending hundreds of billions on COBRA is a giveaway to health insurance CEOs and leaves millions uninsured.

In the last six weeks 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

It is simply irresponsible and dangerous to the public to allow millions of people in this country to go without health coverage as a pandemic rips through our communities. 

During the pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket health costs for all Americans.

Average cost of coronavirus treatment for patients in intensive care: over $30,000

Percentage of Americans who wouldn't go to the doctor for coronavirus symptoms due to the cost: 14%

We need to guarantee health care as a human right now more than ever. https://t.co/L5BA5kaXpS

As tens of millions of Americans are losing their jobs and incomes as a result of the pandemic, many of them are also losing their health insurance.

We need Medicare for All.

In truth, we don’t have a health care “system.” We have a byzantine network of medical institutions dominated by the profit-making interests of insurance and drug companies.

Instead of bailing out the health care insurance industry during this crisis, Medicare should be required to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and underinsured. That's what I'm fighting for. No one should be denied care because of the cost.

We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.

We must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All.

Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers.

The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.
 
That means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.
 
Under Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job.

While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick.

We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy.

Americans deserve better than a health care system where  people are terrified and need treatment, but are afraid to go to the doctor or emergency room because they cannot afford the bill. They deserve Medicare for All.

We must construct emergency shelters and utilize vacant lodging to provide survivors of domestic violence the shelter, the health care and the nutrition they need, and to connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. https://t.co/DER7G1VvzB

We must move forward on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package.

This bill must protect workers, not hand out more corporate welfare. 

It must provide a full paycheck for laid off workers for the duration of the crisis, and guarantee health care for all.

Our health care system should be about protecting lives, not making huge profits for corporations.

We are facing estimates of over 100,000 coronavirus deaths. It is outrageous that a Philadelphia real estate investor who closed a hospital is now trying to gouge the city to re-open it. @HelenGymPHL is right: the city should reopen Hahnemann hospital immediately. https://t.co/V08gYcxxfq

There is something very, very wrong when we spend twice as much per capita on health care as other major countries, yet tens of millions are uninsured and we have worse health outcomes.

The profit-driven health care system has got to change.

We need Medicare for All.

Our dysfunctional health care system must be replaced by a Medicare for All, single-payer system, which not only guarantees health care for everyone as a right, but has a strong public health component which prepares our country for health care crises like the coronavirus.

Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace. https://t.co/sZrb6FcUPz

Not surprisingly, the Republican plan for the coronavirus pandemic is totally inadequate. 

It benefits the rich and large corporations, creates desperation for poor and working families and goes nowhere near far enough to address the health and economic crises we're facing.

Uninsured Americans not only have to worry about getting sick from the coronavirus.

They have to worry about whether getting health care would bankrupt them.

During an international crisis or not, health care must always be a right.

Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people.

We are the richest country in the history of the world. Every worker deserves a living wage, paid leave, health care, and a union—at all times, not just during a national crisis.

Our current health care system does not have the doctors and nurses we currently need. During this crisis, we need to mobilize medical residents, retired medical professionals, and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis.

We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get health care they need regardless of their income. In this crisis we must empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency.

I proudly stood with @PennaNurses and @District1199C to fight the closure of Hahnemann. We must re-open such hospitals and fund the creation of new facilities to address this pandemic. I hope that other cities and states will follow Philadelphia's lead. https://t.co/jhnJO8nH0m

The insurance industry lies that Medicare for All will mean "long wait times."

There is an endless wait in America happening now—for those waiting to be able to afford care they need.

Trump and too many Republicans and Democrats in Congress want to approve a defense budget increasing military spending to $740 billion a year. Wrong! We should cut military spending and invest in jobs, education, housing and health care. I will introduce legislation to do that.

We have a system today where, while millions lose their jobs, struggle to put food on the table, and cannot afford an education or health care, billionaires have gotten $565 billion richer during a pandemic. That is a system we cannot accept.

Racial injustice goes far beyond police brutality. Black families have 1/10th the wealth of white families, over half of Black workers earn less than $15/hour, and Black families are much less likely to have decent health insurance. The fight for justice continues on all fronts.

100,000 are dead from coronavirus, 40 million apply for unemployment benefits, 20% of children are hungry, millions face eviction and lack health care. Meanwhile, Trump and Republican leadership don't see the "urgency" for new legislation to protect the working class. Outrageous!

It is catastrophic that tens of millions of Americans are losing their health insurance—on top of the millions already uninsured.

Nancy Pelosi is right. We must include the Paycheck Security Act in the next emergency legislation. The best way to protect our economy is to guarantee that, in the midst of this terrible crisis, workers continue receiving their paychecks and health care.
https://t.co/MLTobZCb2K

You need health care whether you’re working or not, whether you have a good- or bad-paying job, whether you’re old or a kid.

Health care must be a human right. 

If we don’t learn that lesson right now, we will never learn that lesson.

71% of jobless Americans did not receive unemployment benefits in March. That is shameful.

Congress has got to guarantee paychecks, health care and $2,000 a month to every American until this crisis ends. The American people cannot afford to wait.
https://t.co/gGslWJTBNa

Do we really want to continue the current expensive and cruel system that ties health care to jobs? Or do we need a simple, comprehensive and cost-effective system that understands that health care is a human right for all of our people?

We must use this time to reassess the foundational institutions of American society and determine how we go forward into a better future. 

Let us, finally, guarantee health care to all our people as a human right.
https://t.co/PLz41C9hsU

I am disgusted that health insurance companies want to profit off the pandemic. Spending hundreds of billions on COBRA is a giveaway to health insurance CEOs and leaves millions uninsured.

No politician in Washington should reward this kind of greed.
https://t.co/NhRy8gxRYf

What does it say about the greed of our current health care system that during a pandemic and economic collapse, patients are aggressively harassed by medical debt collectors?  

Medical debt should not exist. 

We need Medicare for All.
https://t.co/2PA8o5QG35

In the last six weeks 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment.

That is catastrophic and unprecedented.

Instead of giveaways to profitable corporations, Congress must continue paychecks to unemployed workers and ensure health care for all. https://t.co/sbo1TTrYuQ

It is simply irresponsible and dangerous to the public to allow millions of people in this country to go without health coverage as a pandemic rips through our communities. 

During the pandemic, Medicare should cover all out-of-pocket health costs for all Americans.

Average cost of coronavirus treatment for patients in intensive care: over $30,000

Percentage of Americans who wouldn't go to the doctor for coronavirus symptoms due to the cost: 14%

We need to guarantee health care as a human right now more than ever. https://t.co/L5BA5kaXpS

How did it happen that after spending twice as much per person on health care as other major countries, we still had 87 million people uninsured or underinsured and were unprepared for the pandemic? https://t.co/GpORBO2AtL

✅Everyone has the health care they need without out-of-pocket expenses
✅Every adult receives $2,000 a month

We are the only wealthy nation on Earth where our people are losing jobs and health care at precisely the moment that they need them the most. Congress must fully restore the wages and benefits of every rank-and-file worker in America during this pandemic.

The current health care system is fatally flawed. Your health care cannot simply be an employee benefit. It must be a right. https://t.co/Yr8OerCZGW

Some 22 million Americans have filed for unemployment. Up to 35 million are expected to become uninsured. We need to pass the Paycheck Security Act to cover workers' wages and benefits until the economic and public health crisis is resolved.
https://t.co/bsLHtLRfgf

As tens of millions of Americans are losing their jobs and incomes as a result of the pandemic, many of them are also losing their health insurance. 

That is what happens when health care is seen as an employee benefit, not a guaranteed right. 

We need Medicare for All.

In truth, we don’t have a health care “system.” We have a byzantine network of medical institutions dominated by the profit-making interests of insurance and drug companies.

Instead of bailing out the health care insurance industry during this crisis, Medicare should be required to pay all of the medical bills of the uninsured and underinsured. That's what I'm fighting for. No one should be denied care because of the cost.

It is outrageous and unsustainable that we have a health care system which ties your health care to your employment. That has got to change. https://t.co/9PxP8tWolq

For the duration of this emergency, the government should cover all the health care our people need with no out-of-pocket expenses. Then we continue fighting for Medicare for All.

Now more than ever, we must understand that a health care should not be a privilege tied to employment status or income. Medicare for All means no one loses coverage. Period.

The coronavirus does not differentiate based on immigration status and our economic and health response must not either. Guaranteeing all residents the assistance they need makes us safer, stronger, and is the morally right thing to do.

Hotspots like NYC are in dire need of supplies to protect the health care workers risking their lives to care for others. I agree with @BilldeBlasio and @nynurses: Trump must stop playing political games and get it done now. https://t.co/yjF2n25rRs

Your health care cannot be tied to your employment. It has to be seen as a human right. https://t.co/oUtqOYfDIc

At a time when millions are losing their jobs AND their health care, the American people are now seeing the gross deficiencies in our employer-based private health care system. Health care is a human right, not an employee benefit. Medicare for All!

It is absurd that someone could be diagnosed with coronavirus and receive a massive bill for the treatment. We must come together and make health care a right for all. https://t.co/btkEfLkREg

In the midst of the exploding unemployment and public health crises, Congress must pass new and unprecedented emergency legislation that guarantees health care for all and allows every American worker to continue receiving their paycheck. Working on details now.

We need Medicare for All so that your health insurance is not tied to your job.

I support workers who strike, conduct a sick-out, or participate in a walk-off to support our collective health and safety amid this pandemic. Period.

The cruelty and absurdity of our for-profit health care system is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been. The American people want Medicare for All. https://t.co/cgsW1x8s8M

We cannot continue to have a dysfunctional, greedy health care system which ties most people's health care coverage to employment, leaves tens of millions uninsured and bankrupts over 500,000 people a year.

We must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All.

Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers.

The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.
 
That means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.
 
Under Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job.

While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick.

We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy.

Americans deserve better than a health care system where  people are terrified and need treatment, but are afraid to go to the doctor or emergency room because they cannot afford the bill. They deserve Medicare for All.

We must construct emergency shelters and utilize vacant lodging to provide survivors of domestic violence the shelter, the health care and the nutrition they need, and to connect those individuals with social services to ensure nobody is left behind. https://t.co/DER7G1VvzB

We must move forward on a fourth coronavirus stimulus package.

This bill must protect workers, not hand out more corporate welfare. 

It must provide a full paycheck for laid off workers for the duration of the crisis, and guarantee health care for all.

Our health care system should be about protecting lives, not making huge profits for corporations.

There is something very, very wrong when we spend twice as much per capita on health care as other major countries, yet tens of millions are uninsured and we have worse health outcomes.

The profit-driven health care system has got to change.

We need Medicare for All.

Our dysfunctional health care system must be replaced by a Medicare for All, single-payer system, which not only guarantees health care for everyone as a right, but has a strong public health component which prepares our country for health care crises like the coronavirus.

Corporate-run health insurance isn't about saving lives. It's about making as much money as possible. With Medicare for All we can finally put an end to this international disgrace. https://t.co/sZrb6FcUPz

Using this health and economic crisis to union bust is morally unacceptable. I’m calling on @Everlane to bring workers back on payroll and recognize the @EverlaneU. https://t.co/5AC2cMhwzw

People today are dying, knowing they're sick, but they're not going to the hospital because they can't afford the bill that they'll be picking up.

That is an international disgrace.

We need to make health care a right.

This is absolutely barbaric. The cruelty and absurdity of our for-profit health care system is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been. We need Medicare for All. https://t.co/jUsEA1Lp5M

Losing your job and being unemployed is difficult enough. You shouldn’t lose your health insurance too. Medicare for All means always being covered.

The fact that we are the only major country not to guarantee paid leave, and millions of workers cannot take paid sick days, is a public health emergency.

Medicare for All means never losing your health insurance if you lose your job. That is what we must guarantee to the American people.

It is unacceptable that healthcare workers are being forced to treat COVID-19 patients without personal protective equipment (PPE). Donald Trump must immediately invoke the Defense Production Act so that we can speed up the production of PPE for workers. https://t.co/Nfg02hYr1l

It is outrageous that right-wing politicians in states like Texas and Ohio are using this crisis to risk women's health and safety by denying their right to abortion and other reproductive health care. Instead, we should be expanding access with things like telemedicine.

Trump must use the Defense Production Act to produce hundreds of millions of the protective equipment we need. As our health care workers are protected, we must also focus on all workers at risk, including @TWULocal100 members exposed every day: https://t.co/MkcU8SFlMq

I do not think you only have a right to health care if you have the money to afford it. I think you have a right to health care because you are a human being.

Not surprisingly, the Republican plan for the coronavirus pandemic is totally inadequate. 

It benefits the rich and large corporations, creates desperation for poor and working families and goes nowhere near far enough to address the health and economic crises we're facing.

Uninsured Americans not only have to worry about getting sick from the coronavirus.

They have to worry about whether getting health care would bankrupt them.

During an international crisis or not, health care must always be a right.

Tonight, I will be holding a virtual roundtable on the economic and health crises created by the coronavirus outbreak. Tune in at 7 p.m. ET at https://t.co/vreIiWfeoS. https://t.co/p01FifNN0s

Right now 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured.

Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people.

During this crisis, Medicare should cover all health care treatment for free, including coronavirus testing, treatment, and the eventual vaccine. https://t.co/ldCzfbl9Km

We are the richest country in the history of the world. Every worker deserves a living wage, paid leave, health care, and a union—at all times, not just during a national crisis.

Our current health care system does not have the doctors and nurses we currently need. During this crisis, we need to mobilize medical residents, retired medical professionals, and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis.

We need to make certain that everybody in our country who needs to go to a doctor can get health care they need regardless of their income. In this crisis we must empower Medicare to cover all medical bills during this emergency.

The crisis we face from coronavirus is on the scale of a major war.

Read our principles for responding to the health care and economic crises, and if you have thoughts or ideas to share with us, email info@berniesanders.com.
https://t.co/vo5oU09v5t

This must be a moment in which people ask fundamental questions about the rationality of our current health care system, which exists to make corporations as much profit as possible, regardless of the consequences.

As we continue to fight for universal health care and paid leave, it has never been more important to strengthen the trade union movement. Workers must have the right to collectively bargain for better pay, stronger benefits, and more power over their lives.

No one should ever be bankrupted because they got sick.

In the midst of this emergency, the U.S. government must be clear that everyone in our country must be able to get all of the health care they need without cost. Period. https://t.co/Ncy63qB8sU

This coronavirus pandemic exposes the incredible weakness and dysfunctionality of our current health care system.

We are the only major country not to guarantee health care to all our people.

We've been told over and over that Medicare for All is "too radical."

I think it's radical to have a health care system that leaves 87 million people uninsured or underinsured.

I think it's radical that people can't afford to see a doctor during a pandemic.

While we work to pass Medicare for All, the U.S. government must be clear that in the midst of this emergency, everyone in our country—regardless of income or where they live—must be able to get the health care they need without cost. https://t.co/d1kkGJfqay

Our government and our economy are rigged in favor of the wealthy.

We need an economy that works for working people, not just the 1% and huge corporations.

Mental health care is health care. No one should be barred from accessing it because of their income. That's why it's covered under Medicare for All.

The ideas we are talking about—a livable planet, health care as a right, a humane immigration system, disability justice, a living wage for all—are not radical ideas. These are issues of basic justice.

Trump said, "We will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.”

Really?

This is the same president who came one vote away from throwing 32 million Americans off the health care they have and ending the Affordable Care Act’s protection for pre-existing conditions.

We can become a nation where every person makes a living wage, lives in a decent home, and can get the health care they need. Together, that is the nation we're going to build.

Our country is facing a crisis in mental health.

A growing number of doctors are sick and tired of the enormous waste and bureaucracy in our cruel and dysfunctional health care system.

Medicare for All will give doctors the freedom to focus on making their patients healthy, not making health insurance executives wealthy. https://t.co/JaxnF6UDHg

You shouldn't lose your health insurance if you lose your job.

You shouldn't lose your health insurance if you get divorced.

You shouldn't lose your health insurance if you turn 26.

You should never lose your health insurance.

Medicare for All now.

Americans should not be paying 20 or 30% of their incomes on health care.

We must have the guts to take on the insurance and drug companies.

It won't be easy, but that is what we have to do. https://t.co/pnilOjURDy

What sacrifices have you had to make in order to afford health insurance?

Tens of thousands of Americans die every year because they don't have the health care that they need. I think the American people have a right to be angry about that.

If you have health insurance, you'd think you can go to the doctor when you need to.

Nope!

Not if you have an outrageous deductible that you cannot afford.

We are going to eliminate deductibles, premiums and co-pays with Medicare for All.

Public housing residents should not be forced to live in unhealthy and unsafe conditions.

The Green New Deal for Public Housing I introduced with @AOC will ensure that public housing residents in Durham and across America live in safe homes.
https://t.co/ZfXD9q5ltd

This campaign is about human solidarity.

Are you willing to fight for someone without health care even if you have insurance?

Are you willing to fight for immigrants even if you are native-born?

Are you willing to fight for America's children even if you have none?

Political elites wonder why so many young people support our campaign.

If you listen to young people, you'll hear they're worried about the climate crisis, student debt, endless war, affording decent housing and having health care.

It's simple: We are listening to young people.

We need Medicare for All.

But to create a healthy society we also must end poverty and provide decent-paying jobs.

We need education, a clean environment, and equal opportunity regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or where you are from.

Those are health issues too.

The last I heard, dental care is health care. That's why we cover it as a right under Medicare for All.

A president of the United States, I will not only be commander-in-chief.

I will also be the organizer-in-chief.

When millions of people stand up for education, for health care, to fight climate change, we can create the kind of movement that will transform this country.

We cannot continue to act as though it is normal when Americans must spend as much as a third of their income on health care.

It's not.

We are going to join the rest of the industrialized world by passing Medicare for All and eliminating co-pays, premiums and deductibles.

I have some bad news for those of you who love arguing with health insurance companies.

You'll have to find someone new to argue with.

Medicare for All means you won't have to fight a corporation to get care you need.

High-quality, comprehensive health care will be guaranteed.

On Jan. 1, millions of Americans' health insurance deductibles will reset.

The way our health care system works today is that if you are unlucky enough to get hurt or sick in two weeks instead of today, you might not be able to afford care you need.

Is that not totally absurd?

I'm so glad to have @alaw202 on our side in the fight to expand Social Security, lower prescription drug costs, and guarantee health care to all our people through Medicare for All. https://t.co/VYEBeP8XYj

Having private health insurance doesn’t mean a damn thing if you have a $5,000 deductible that you can’t afford. 

That is why Medicare for All will eliminate deductibles, along with co-payments and premiums.

There is something fundamentally wrong when we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as other major countries and our average life expectancy is going DOWN.

We must become a nation where all our people are able to live long and healthy lives—not just those with the means to afford outrageous health care costs.

I believe that every person in America deserves to live in dignity and security. That is why we must guarantee health care, decent housing, a living wage and a good education to all our people.

Insulin costs $6 per vial to make. Diabetics need it to survive.

Pharma companies in the U.S. sell it for over $300.

Our health care system today is not about keeping people alive.

It is about making huge profits.

Medicare for All is about changing that gross injustice.

I refuse to leave our grandchildren a planet that is not healthy and habitable. We need a Green New Deal.

We shouldn't blame millennials for their financial distress.

We should blame and reverse the policies of the last 40 years which have:

-Rigged our economy for the rich
-Saddled young people with massive student debt
-Made health care unaffordable

We will pass Medicare for All.
We will eliminate co-pays, premiums and deductibles.
We will make health care a right to all.
We will end the disgrace of a profit-driven system.

My fight is with the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry and with the greed and corruption of the health insurance industry.

The purpose of private health insurance is not to provide affordable care to all. It is to make huge profits for a handful of rich people.

I support Decatur's teaching assistants in their fight for a fair contract. As president, we will invest in our educators—and I will fight for Medicare for All to ensure that no worker has to walk a picket line to afford health care for their families. https://t.co/9XiE5fNQFF

You should be able to leave a job or a marriage without fear of losing your health insurance. Medicare for All means safety and security.

Medicare for All means that if you or your loved ones are in the hospital, you will not be on the phone arguing with insurance companies who are trying to deny you coverage. It means focusing on getting healthy.

Last year 91 corporations paid nothing in federal income taxes, including Amazon, GM and Delta.

When politicians tell you we can't afford education, health care, childcare or clean water, they're lying.

We're going to make huge corporations pay their fair share.

A vial of insulin costs $6 to make.

This is not our health care system malfunctioning. This is exactly how it is designed to work: make as much profit for corporations as possible, regardless of the human cost. https://t.co/FIo3nGqNd3

If you are struggling, if you can't afford your medication, if you don't have health insurance, if you're drowning in student debt, if you can't live on starvation wages—you are not alone, and we are fighting for you.

How much is your health insurance deductible?

"Medicare for all who want it" leaves in place a system designed to make huge profits for drug and insurance companies, not guarantee health care for all. 

We cannot have an effective health care system as long as greedy corporations are allowed to dictate our priorities. https://t.co/Q1kEJrNZAf

Our health care system is barbaric.

Taking care of a loved one who is sick is hard enough without fighting an insurance company whose only interest is profit.

We are going to pass Medicare for All. We will eliminate medical debt. https://t.co/upmfAVFClB

Under Medicare for All you will never lose health coverage, even if you:

-Are low-income
-Leave your job
-Turn 26
-Move to another state
-Have a pre-existing condition
-Get laid off
-Get divorced
-Retire early

Mayo Clinic executives have decided to strip away access to health care from tens of thousands of rural Midwesterners—putting profits over people. Under Medicare for All we will end the corporate greed in health care that is leaving rural Americans behind.
https://t.co/0niOP7A5TI

Thousands of people in America die every year because they can't afford health care. Medicare for All is going to save lives.

Before we create a Space Force we should make sure everyone has health care.

I don't think Democrats should be using health insurance industry talking points to scare Americans about Medicare for All.

The bottom line: Medicare for All will save the average American thousands of dollars a year and guarantee comprehensive coverage to all.

When young people say they want to go to college without taking on mountains of debt, we must listen.

When young people say they want to end the criminalization of marijuana, we must listen.
