There is nothing more important than giving our kids the love and support they need.Trump had a bad night in Tulsa. Very low turnout. Even his supporters know that COVID-19 is real and dangerous, and should not be spread at an indoor rally. More importantly, maybe people are catching on that he is a pathological liar and a fraud.

A new poll finds only 35% of Americans believe he is honest. In a democracy we can have different views, but not a president who is a pathological liar.Mitch McConnell says we should end the $600 unemployment bonus because workers now earn more by not working.

I've got a better approach.

Let's end starvation wages in America and raise the minimum wage to a living wage.

All workers are entitled to a decent standard of living.We need real police department reform. Every police officer involved in a killing must be held accountable, and those found guilty must be punished with the full force of the law.  Every killing of a person held in police custody must be investigated by the Department of Justice.George Floyd’s murder is not only an outrage. It is the latest manifestation of a system that callously devalues the lives of Black people. Our struggle is and always has been about justice—not justice on paper, but real justice in the real lives of real people. https://t.co/03LHnirfHqWhat we need is a nation that fundamentally respects the human dignity of every person. That starts with justice for George Floyd. https://t.co/XvC3rd4tpSWe’re postponing tonight’s livestream in order to keep the attention on the killing of George Floyd and the need for this country to end police violence. https://t.co/7nZchamxZvDonald Trump's attempt to exploit this tragedy for his own political gain is inexcusable. His penchant for authoritarianism and violence is more and more apparent.  Mr. President, don't encourage police officers to do more shooting. That is exactly the problem.Every officer involved in George Floyd's murder must be arrested and held criminally accountable. Going forward, the DOJ must independently investigate every time a person dies in police custody. That includes officers who passively stand by and allow these killings to happen.Having met with so many families brutalized by police violence, it's clear we cannot wait any longer to act forcefully and boldly to root out the cancer of systemic racism and police violence against people of color. This must end.Tonight, join me for a screening of "The Revolutionist," a film on the life and times of Eugene Debs, with a panel discussion featuring @NicholsUprising and @mrdannyglover.

Every worker deserves a living wage.The global pandemic is pushing over half a billion people into poverty. Meanwhile the 25 richest people on Earth have increased their wealth by $255 billion. We need international solidarity. We must address the grotesque level of wealth inequality that's getting worse every day.Republicans make fun of Democrats who have political differences. Really? That's democracy. What is sad and dangerous is to see a Republican Party, including many who know better, surrender to the will and vindictiveness of their "stable genius" leader.

In their memory, we pledge to stand firm in defending American democracy against all who would undermine it.Today is a day for us to remember and cherish the many service members who died serving this nation and to acknowledge the unimaginable loss of their families and loved ones. Jane and I wish everyone a safe, peaceful and reflective #MemorialDay.Donald Trump is a bad president. He is a worse "doctor." In the midst of a pandemic, he has ignored the advice of scientists and physicians and has peddled unsound and dangerous medical ideas.

We don't need more bombast, lies and rhetoric from the White House. We don't need 50 states moving in different directions. We need a national policy which is based on science.Let's hope that, after clinical trials, this vaccine proves effective. If so, the government must negotiate a fair price with the company, and then distribute the vaccine free to all Americans. Nobody should die or get sick because they lack the money to buy a lifesaving vaccine. https://t.co/oSl6YNDtZdBefore this crisis, half of our people lived paycheck to paycheck.

Tens of millions had no health insurance.

Some 40 million people lived in poverty. 500,000 slept on the streets.

We cannot just go "back to normal."

We must go forward and build an economy that works for all.People should not have to risk their lives and endanger their families to have income in a pandemic. One $1,200 check is not enough. We must ensure every person in this country receives $2,000 a month for the duration of this crisis.If there's anything I hope we learn out of this painful experience, it is that maybe we create an economy and a government that works for all, not just the few and wealthy campaign contributors.It’s incomprehensible to me that we have Republican leadership and a president who refuse to recognize the severity of the pain people are experiencing right now. https://t.co/U6H3gXQKHgRT @ABCPolitics: “This president thinks he’s above the law, he’s above criticism.

Medicare must be empowered to cover all health care expenses during this crisis. 

We can not abandon the American people.If we can bail out large corporations, we can ensure that everyone in this country can support themselves and afford basic necessities. 

Congress must make sure that every working-class household receives a $2,000 monthly payment for each family member in this crisis.“All that stuff that pundits said about the Green New Deal, ‘It’s unrealistic,’ ‘It’s radical,’ ‘It’s crazy,’ ‘It’s never going to happen’ — all of that I believe could become possible in this moment because there is a rupture emerging.” –@VarshPrakash https://t.co/bvVOR8tHZlRT @AGEllison: New season of my podcast, Affording Your Life, available now.

We must guarantee health care as a human right through Medicare for All.Under Medicare for All, rural hospitals would finally have consistent funding rather than being forced into closure based on the business models of profit-seeking health insurers.The Federal Reserve estimates that upwards of 47 million people could lose their jobs.
 
That means tens of millions losing insurance in addition to the 30 million already uninsured.
 
Under Medicare for All, no one would lose their health insurance if they lost their job.While there is no simple health care fix to the destruction of coronavirus, under a Medicare for All system, everyone would have comprehensive health care free at the point of service. No one would avoid going to the doctor due to cost, or go into debt just for getting sick.We must never forget that we are only as healthy as the least insured among us. When one of us gets sick, all of us have the potential to get sick. When our neighbor loses their job, that hurts our community and local economy.The coronavirus pandemic is highlighting every day the many ways in which our country leaves the poor and vulnerable behind.

Millions of workers have no paid leave.

Half our people live paycheck to paycheck.

The unprecedented crises we are living in call for an unprecedented response. 

If there is any silver lining in the horrific situation we now find ourselves in, it is the need to understand how we got here and how we can prevent future disasters like this.It is simply absurd that massive corporations who make billions in profits every year claim they cannot afford to guarantee paid sick leave to their workers.If our medical personnel go down, who will treat the American people?

The federal government must immediately put together the necessary staffing and technology to address the unprecedented number of requests for help that are coming in.This is a crisis.

The stimulus package just passed can provide real help to millions, but it won’t matter unless the federal bureaucracy is able to implement the program and get the money out.

No business as usual. People need help NOW, not in several months.Losing your job and being unemployed is difficult enough. You shouldn’t lose your health insurance too. Medicare for All means always being covered.The fact that we are the only major country not to guarantee paid leave, and millions of workers cannot take paid sick days, is a public health emergency.RT @athenaforall: "We have to make sure where we're working at is safe.

Watch at 6 p.m.…It is outrageous that right-wing politicians in states like Texas and Ohio are using this crisis to risk women's health and safety by denying their right to abortion and other reproductive health care. Instead, we should be expanding access with things like telemedicine.Trump must use the Defense Production Act to produce hundreds of millions of the protective equipment we need. As our health care workers are protected, we must also focus on all workers at risk, including @TWULocal100 members exposed every day: https://t.co/MkcU8SFlMqIn a dark time, this is very good news.

Guarantee paid sick leave now. https://t.co/XCci1x54q6We will get through this crisis by supporting each other and the most vulnerable. We identified new, important charities doing essential work during the pandemic. Can you add a contribution to support them? https://t.co/qJs9L2dLFNWe cannot give Trump’s Treasury Department a blank check to bail out the airlines, cruise ships, hotels, and many other industries, while providing next to nothing to help the homeless or the most vulnerable people in this country. 6/6Corporate pork producers are using the coronavirus to push Congress to expedite guest worker visas, even at a time when international travel and immigration is largely shut down. 5/6Adidas wants to sneak in a long-sought provision allowing people to use pretax money to pay for gym memberships and fitness equipment — even when many gyms and retail stores are closed nationwide. 4/6The National Association of Manufacturers wants $1.4 trillion, and the International Council of Shopping Centers wants a guarantee of up to $1 trillion. 3/6The airline industry is asking for $50 billion, the private space industry is asking for $5 billion, and the hotel industry wants $150 billion. 2/6Now is not the time to allow large corporations to take advantage of this horrific crisis by profiteering and ripping off U.S. taxpayers.

Not only are the lives of the heroes and heroines providing medical care on the line, the lives of millions across the rest of the country are on the line as well.

If our medical front line goes down, the whole country is at risk.The president must immediately and forcefully use the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers to produce all of the personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other medical supplies that we need to get through this crisis.Unbelievably, in the U.S. right now, doctors and nurses are unnecessarily putting their lives on the line treating people suffering from the coronavirus because they lack personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, and surgical gowns.

That is unacceptable.Emergency funding for any industry must come with the condition that workers keep their jobs and receive a living wage. I am proud to stand alongside @32BJSEIU in the fight to ensure that workers don't bear the cost of this crisis. https://t.co/z9iHj6UXRJSuspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs nationwide.We need fundamental change to an economy that leaves far too many working people behind.

It benefits the rich and large corporations, creates desperation for poor and working families and goes nowhere near far enough to address the health and economic crises we're facing.Uninsured Americans not only have to worry about getting sick from the coronavirus.

Our profit-driven health care system is a danger to our people.

During this crisis, Medicare should cover all health care treatment for free, including coronavirus testing, treatment, and the eventual vaccine. https://t.co/ldCzfbl9KmWe are the richest country in the history of the world.

Split a contribution between five charities that are fighting for kids, the economically disadvantaged, and workers during the pandemic: https://t.co/mJGDh6gbz4More than 45 million Americans struggle with $1.6 trillion in student debt.

We must cancel all student loan payments for the duration of this emergency.

Long-term, we must cancel all student debt and make public colleges, universities, and trade schools tuition- and debt-free.Our current health care system does not have the doctors and nurses we currently need. During this crisis, we need to mobilize medical residents, retired medical professionals, and other medical personnel to help us deal with this crisis.RT @AOC: 🚨 If you live in New York &amp; have an employer, you are now eligible for paid sick leave.

What is something someone has done to help you, or what have you done to reach out to others?I proudly stood with @PennaNurses and @District1199C to fight the closure of Hahnemann. We must re-open such hospitals and fund the creation of new facilities to address this pandemic. I hope that other cities and states will follow Philadelphia's lead. https://t.co/jhnJO8nH0mIt's been estimated that the unemployment rate could hit 20% if we don't act boldly. A one or two time check isn't good enough—the government must tell every small and mid-sized business owner that we'll cover 100% of their payroll if they don't lay off anyone during this crisis.The crisis we face from coronavirus is on the scale of a major war.

Join me tonight at 9:15 pm ET for a national volunteer call and learn how you can get involved: https://t.co/bmg9wREWsg https://t.co/YI98NtqpXdWe're building a multiracial, multigenerational movement for real change, and that is how we are going to defeat Donald Trump. https://t.co/1naupmrb1NCongratulations to @IndivisiUnion for coming together to form a union in your workplace. @IndivisbleTeam and their members know that real change comes from the grassroots, and we look forward to working with all of you to defeat Donald Trump. https://t.co/JJABCiyvB5Trump called the press the "enemy of the people." Now—taking a page from his dictator friends—he's trying to dismantle the First Amendment right to a free press. In November we will defeat him, restore the rule of law, and protect our constitutional rights. https://t.co/dzHVYsBkq0When we win the primary and defeat Trump, we’re not cutting Social Security. We’re expanding Social Security — whether billionaires like it or not. https://t.co/hK4gWzZx4dThe billionaire class has never had it so good. It's time for an economy and a government that work for working people so that all Americans can live in dignity. Join us live in Myrtle Beach: https://t.co/Z2JUrSMtqIOver 200 million Muslims call India home. Widespread anti-Muslim mob violence has killed at least 27 and injured many more.

We are going to guarantee free, high-quality child care and pre-k for all. https://t.co/zELo98fzEYTrump and his Republican friends gave over a trillion dollars in tax breaks to the top 1% and large corporations.

For that reason I will not attend their conference. 1/2Trump and his friends think they're going to win by dividing our people up based on the color of our skin, where we were born, our religion or our sexual orientation.

We're going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite: We are bringing our people together.The American people are sick and tired of a corrupt administration that is undermining American democracy.

They are sick and tired of a government based on greed and lies.

It is time for an administration based on racial, social, economic and environmental justice.This movement is about empowering people the political process has ignored for far too long. We have the multiracial, multigenerational coalition to win the White House. Live from Houston: https://t.co/6E8N6R5PkXAs our movement grows, we will be attacked. But our job now is to bring people together in a multi-racial, multi-generational movement for real change. When we stand together, we will defeat the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.It is not acceptable for Americans to need two or three jobs to put food on the table.

It's not acceptable that half of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.

It's not acceptable that three people own more wealth than the bottom half of Americans.First we won the popular vote in Iowa. Then we won the New Hampshire primary. And now we have won the Nevada caucus.

Let's go forward together and win it all.
